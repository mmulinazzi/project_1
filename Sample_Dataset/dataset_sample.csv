As a collector and huge fan of all things Monster High, this Scaris Convertible doesn't disappoint!  Like Draculaura's car that was released back with the Sweet 1600 line, this car is a little lighter than your traditional Barbie car and made entirely of plastic.  It's purple and black exterior is decked out in super cool cutouts.<br /><br />While it is a very light car, it looks like it will take a lot of play before breaking.  That is helped by the fact that it doesn't have open/shut doors and is essentially one piece.  The tires spin fine.  No problems with them whatsoever.<br /><br />I am enjoying this Scaris Convertible.  It is great for playtime, as well as photo ops!","15898","2013","Toys"

She loves the toy and has played with it pretty much nonstop since opening it. Her Barbies have been throughly enjoying their camping trips. As a parent, I will say that the camper is very visually appealing. There are tons of little details, like cereal boxes, egg cartons and a frying pan so Barbie can make breakfast and my girls love putting Barbie, Stacy and Chealsea to bed in the triple bunk. The campfire with the s'mores sticks is adorable. However, the quality leaves a lot to be desired. The back panel is cardboard and pops out of place whenever the slightest pressure is put on it- and since its a camper on wheels it gets pushed quite a bit. The rear view mirrors on the car pop off very easily as well. If you have younger kids, be prepared to be constantly fixing parts. To me, the $90 price tag is too high for the quality, so wait for it to go on sale.","16391","2014","Toys"
