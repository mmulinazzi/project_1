# Project Description/Outline
Our goal is to pull data from Amazon AWS using the product category of Toys. We want to look at number of reviews, average star ratings,
and perform some product comparisons between the most popular toys.

# Research Questions to Answer
Which toys receive the most reviews?
Which toys recieve the best star ratings?
Can the toys be easily broken down into various categories, like "building blocks" or "bikes?"
